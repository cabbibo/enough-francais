var TEXT = {ALONE:["For My Teachers\n\nWho somehow managed to put up with me,\nEspecially the two who had it the worst:\n\nMom & Dad.\n", "When Mani awoke, she had no idea where she was. \n\nA soft seabed sparkled beneath her, a small island in a sea of darkness.\n\nShe swam, slowly discovering the physics of her form. \n", "The emptiness surrounding the island was so massive, Mani could not tell if she even moved. Still, she glided on, delighting at the soft swish of her tail, the gentle motion of her spine.\n\nAs Mani roamed farther away from the light, the silence surrounding her allowed her to think, to question: What was she? Who was she? Why was she? And what else was out there?\n", "She wandered further and further into the darkness until the seabed was just a glimmer in the distance. For a moment, she thought of turning back, but a vast unknown lay in front of her and she was excited to discover it.\n"], CRYSTALS:["After an eternity of drifting through the ether, Mani discovered a land of crystals.\n\nSo splendid they stood, stoic yet playful, each with its own voice and melody. As sparkles and  sounds cascaded into the world around her, Mani\u2019s entire being shimmered with glee. \n", "Small bands pulsed along the crystals, each overtone and harmony reflected in their scintillating surfaces. \n\nMani could feel the aria flowing through her, her scales and splines fluttering with melody.\n", "Their simple existence filled Mani with wonder. Why were they here? How could they sing? What were they saying?\n\nShe danced with delight through their glistening glitter. How could they be? What could they be?\n", "She felt a certain camaraderie with the crystals. They too must have awoken suddenly, albeit ages ago. Mani pondered if their awakening was as confusing as hers.\n\nAs Mani wondered, so she wandered, drifting away from the crystals, hoping for answers.\n"], FOREST:["Mani floated through the darkness until she came upon a soft garden of metallic tendrils. \n\nShe swam through the sweeping stalks, enjoying the soft plinks and hums they created. They made way for her slender form, bowing before her as though she were royalty.\n", "The trees\u2019 voice and body were one in the same. Each overtone of the melody rippled up the pillars, their structures expanding and contracting to the song of the forest.\n\nSubtle as the movement was, this quivering exactly embodied their psalm.\n", "It amazed Mani that she had not heard the trees\u2019 chorus until she was right beside them. Surely a song so strong would permeate the void, echoing in every corner of the cosmos.\n\nYet the music could only be heard here, in this small oasis.\n", "Mani envied the stalks that surrounded her. Although they could not travel and witness marvels like the melodious crystals, they had found purpose in their shimmering sanctuary. For them, to sing, no matter if others were listening, was enough. \n\nMani knew no songs, so she continued forth, yearning for more.\n"], TREE:["Mani was growing tired. She had been traveling forever, but still did not know where she was, who she was, why she was. \n\nThe crystals were majestic, the forest wise, but there were so many questions, and Mani did not know if they would ever be answered.\n", "The haunting tree that stood before her mirrored the weariness Mani felt. How could she be part of this world without a reason? Crystals hummed and the trees murmured. They knew their tasks and performed them with a quiet nobility.\n\nMani could not tell what her purpose was.\n", "She stared at the tree, begging and hoping that it would tell her something about why she was here. \n\nYet it stood, unmoving. \n", "Mani felt cold.\n\nThe light of the tree contained no warmth. No comfort could be found examining its branches, no trace of meaning derived from its structure. \n\nIf the tree had a purpose, Mani could not define it. \n", "Beneath the tree, the seabed\u2019s undulations reminded Mani of where she first arose.\n\nShe had seen many sights since then, but what had these sights told her about why she had come into being?\n", "Dejected, she chased the lights that moved around the tree, hoping their shininess would make her forget her hopelessness. \n\nEven they could not quell the feeling that maybe there was no truth, that things simply were, with no rhyme or reason to speak of.\n", "Mani was ready to give up. Alone in the darkness, she shivered. Her travels had taught her how vast this world was. In the face of such greatness, what could her existence possibly mean?\n\nShe wanted to know, without a doubt, that she was here for a reason, that who she was, why she was, what she was, mattered. \n\nShe wished she were the tree. It never had to ask itself these difficult questions.\n", "Then, Mani heard a melody more sweet than she could imagine; saw a color more vibrant than she could comprehend. At first she didn\u2019t understand. Was this just another sparkling object coming to remind her of her emptiness, another frail distraction from her melancholy?\n\nOr was it a creature, like her? A fragile friend, lost in the darkness, yearning for truth?\n"], TOGETHER:["The creature danced and Mani marveled at her movement.\n\nRainbows quivered along her length as she fluttered by Mani. \n\nThe springs of her spine pulsed to the song surrounding them and Mani realized this creature, too, was made from music.\n", "Mani swayed with her in the mists of the night, as she shone with golden light.\n", "Sol was her name; Mani knew.\n\nMani didn\u2019t know quite how she knew it, but at this moment it didn\u2019t really matter. Questions seemed irrelevant, questing superfluous.\n\nMani laughed at how hopeless she had felt but a moment ago. How could she ever be lost if she swam in the warmth of a friend?\n", "As Sol curved and curled through the ether, Mani realized that Sol\u2019s form was a reflection of her own. Mani spun and twisted with renewed vigor, recognizing how majestic her own body could be.\n\nThey continued circling each other in the twilight until Sol motioned to Mani to follow her onwards.\n"], FRIENDS:["As Sol and Mani swam onwards, two more creatures joined them! \n\nThey sang, circling Mani. \n\nTheir bodies were longer than Mani\u2019s, the physics that governed their spines looser. The way they elegantly arced through the dark made it obvious they had been in this world longer, mastering their forms.\n", "The four friends moved on. As Mani led, the others followed closely, guarding Mani from the mists.\n\nMani felt her heart overflowing with joy. Sol alone had chased Mani\u2019s misery away, but having two more creatures, embracing her as one of their own, was serenity.\n", "Out of the mists another creature came. It joined the flock surrounding Mani, its crystalline melody as elegant as the pulsing of its body.\n\nThe way this creature displayed its song was unlike any being before it. Its glittering chassis danced with the rhythm of its melody.\n\nMani had no melody of her own, yet she could feel all of her brethren\u2019s voices woven in her movements.\n", "The revelation of meeting the fourth friend had not even settled in before two more creatures entered the entourage, their songs joining the already flourishing melody. \n\nThey let their bodies fall in line with Mani\u2019s, filling in the phalanx that cloaked her in comfort. The small enclosure they created made Mani finally feel at home.\n", "More creatures approached; Mani could felt her sense of self slowly receding.\n\nAs she basked in the light of her iridescent friends, she felt a force bubble up from deep inside her soul.\n", "There wasn\u2019t just one more of her. There was a myriad.\n\nShe felt the force wash over her in a wave of warmth. She was part of something bigger, a single member of an angelic host.\n\nThis epiphany struck her with such strength; she felt for a moment she had finally found her truth.\n", "Mani wondered why this revelation didn\u2019t sadden her. She was so much less special as just a single piece of the whole. \n\nYet unlike the smallness and confusion she felt when staring at the tree, this feeling spoke to something greater. The being that was her and her friends sang of truth, and she was part of its song.\n", "The creatures smoothly fanned out, their tendrils touching every part of the darkness\n\nSo thoroughly they permeated the mist, the distinction between creature and ether fell away. The world they were a part of, the song they sang, the crystals, forest, and tree, all of it was one in the same. All of it was home.\n", "Mani stared into the darkness and felt no fear.\n\nIt, too, was part of the heavenly tapestry, the entire world woven together. Each minute scale on the creatures bodies, each miniscule chirp of their voices\u2019 and delicate tremble of their spines. The crystals\u2019 sparkles, and gardens\u2019 stalks. The glimmering lights circling the tree, the glistening seabed.\n", "More than ever Mani wanted to explore. She could not wait to reveal new strains of this cosmos\u2019 chorus, to glimpse other golden threads of the sublime tapestry,  to travel through the rest of this mysterious Eden with her iridescent community.\n\nInto the distance they would go, triumphantly, marveling at every wonder they found. Each immaculate miracle would be theirs to discover, experience, and adore. Together.\n"], SPARKLES:["Mani led her friends to a sparkling expanse of stars.\n\nHow glorious these shapes were! As they drifted past her, Mani examined their infinitely precise textures. \"How Sol must love these sequins!\" she thought, and turned to see the sense of wonder emanating from Sol\u2019s being.\n", "But Sol was not behind Mani, and their other friends were not behind Sol. There was just the floating hexagons, Mani, and the darkness.\n\nMani felt a sense of sadness she never before imagined. Where could they have gone? She was sure they followed her, but here in the field of stars, they were nowhere to be seen.\n", "The cold mist surged in around her, and she realized now what it meant to be alone. She had felt the warmth of her friends; to be without it was chilling.\n", "She tried again and again to console herself, trying to see the beauty of her friends in the sequins, but her lonely pain could not be quelled by imagined comfort.\n\nShe had to find them again! No matter what! So she flew onward, praying the direction she traveled would lead her again to the light of her friends.\n \n"], FLOCKING:["Mani could not believe she lost her friends. It was too much to bear. Too much to remember the love she felt for them, she felt for Sol.\n\nAround her, small ribbons flocked. Their motions were soothing but were not enough to help her overcome her heartbreak.\n", "The ribbons moved gently, peacefully swirling around their visitor. Mani could not feel their serenity, only seeing them as ghosts of her lost friends. As sweet as their song seemed, it was not enough, and Mani resigned herself to her well of sorrow.\n\nShe thought she had discovered her meaning amongst her friends, but what truth could so easily be destroyed? She must have been mistaken. How could the dark be part of the tapestry, if all it brought was agony?\n", "She swam, filled with anguish, remembering the crystals, tendrils, and tree. She thought of Sol and her compassionate movements, their friends circling them both. Oh, how she missed them, how she wished she had cherished her time in their presence.\n", "She could feel the darkness curl in around her, winding its icy grip around the deepest part of her being.\n\nShe tried to remember that in her moment of epiphany, she had felt a certain intimacy, a fellowship with the darkness. Though she remembered, she did not feel anything but loneliness.\n\nMani was ready for the quiet to come, for this melancholy fantasy to finally end. \n", "But the quiet did not come, and Mani hoped for something more.\n\nMaybe it was because she could feel some presence near, or just because she refused to believe that this sorrow was all there was. Mani kept moving.\n\nWith every ounce of remaining light in her broken soul, Mani swam forward.\n"], SUN:["In a single moment, all of Mani's sorrow evaporated. The pulsing orb that lay before her was the heart of this world. It sang, so full of light that even the darkness danced.\n\nDrawn by its sheer holiness, Mani approached the deity, examining every inch of its movement.\n", "It undulated hypnotically, its movements massive, yet precise. It was the reason this world was here. It was the threads of the tapestry and the tapestry itself. \n\nIt was pure. \n\nComplete.\n", "Further and further Mani swam, approaching the entity.\n\nIts song sang just for Mani, beckoning her inward, welcoming her into its loving arms. Its voice told of understanding without bounds, of infinite compassion, of warmth that could not be broken.\n\nSo, inward Mani went.\n", "The inside of the beast was even more magnificent than its exterior. \n\nIts opaline shell reflected every color Mani could imagine. The prismatic mandala at its core contained every minute beauty of this world.\n", "The song continued, urging Mani deeper inwards. \n\nA shining portal lay before her, its petals unfolding for her alone. \n\nThe being answered every question she had with no trace of uncertainty or pain.\n\nWho was she? This.\nWhat was she? This.\nWhy was she? This.\n", "The flower\u2019s elegance was something no hardship could destroy, a light no darkness could touch. \n\nSo infinite its truth, why Mani was, mattered not. All that mattered was this almighty maker.\n\nThis shimmering jewel at the center of the world which contained in its reflections all moments that had passed in this vast universe.\n", "Mani had reached the end of her quest.\n\nHer questions were answered and worries extinguished, all by this celestial presence. \n\nIt was truth, light, and beauty. It was rhyme and reason. It was stronger than any sorrow, fear, or discomfort could hope to be.\n", "She swam closer and closer to the center.\n\nShe knew this door was meant for her and no other. She would make the journey alone into the next dimension. She marched towards the opening with all the voices of heaven urging her on.\n\nThen, at that moment of ecstatic epiphany, of Light Infinite, Mani saw a movement.\n", "It was Sol!\n\nSol swam to Mani, and Mani to her.\n", "The being that was the heart of this world sang of the Beyond. \n\nSol sweetly shimmered. \n\nThe heart danced, each breath embodying the essence of the cosmos.\n\nSol slowly swayed.\n", "Mani gazed at the flower at the center of the universe. \n\nSo infinite was its beauty, so divine its movement, so true its voice. \n\nBut Sol spiraled and, as a simple ripple passed along her spine, Mani realized that no rhyme, no reason, no light, no beauty, no truth could ever compare to the sight of seeing Sol.\n", "The being\u2019s truth was infinite, uncompromising. It promised an end to all agony. But Sol promised something more. Mani knew that following Sol would mean experiencing the darkness again. Mani knew she would feel sadness again. She would feel lost again, hurt again, broken again.\n\nTheir friendship could not last forever, but it would for now, and that small, inconsequential relationship contained more truth than this God could ever promise. \n\nThey turned away from the jewel and journeyed on. Together.\n"], FIREWORKS:["Mani and Sol swam away from the creature. It sang to them as they retreated into the night.\n\nLike a fire flickering in the distance, the being whispered its goodbyes, leaving Sol and Mani to circle a golden lake, their reflections keeping them company as they danced, simply content.\n", "In front of them, glorious fireworks rose above the shimmering surface. Their golden glitter reminded Mani of the first sparkles she had seen, coming from the crystals.\n\nShe remembered her loneliness, her confusion, as well as each wonder she had discovered. The ribbons, sequins, and tree were all firmly etched into her memory. \n", " \n\nEven as the two spiraled together, Mani remembered the Golden Deity that had invited her towards the light. She thought, in a moment of regret, that maybe she was mistaken. That maybe she should have explored the world beyond.\n\nBut next to her, Sol swam. In the distance the sparkles shimmered. The water glistened below them, and Mani realized, this was Enough.\n"], CREDITS:["Who could be so lucky?\n\nWho comes to a lake for water\nand sees the reflection of the moon.\n\n-Rumi\n", "Thanks:\n\nSally Visher  Joseph Cohen  Abe Cohen   Xochitl Garcia Nicole Campos  Brian Flynn Ricardo Cabello  Jaume Sanchez West Langley  Ben Cerveny  Max Carlson  Eddie Lee  Jono Brandel   Aki Rodic   Hugh Kennedy  Reza Ali  Robbie Tilton  Bianca Ozeri  Julia Sills  Luke Iannini  Alexandra Hay Kate Mitchell   Ken Russell  Bradon Jones Justin O\u2019Kelly  Josh Carpenter  Casey Yee  Tamsin Glasson  Hit + Run  Leap Motion\n", "Thanks:\n\nPaul Sherman    Jeff Cumpston\n\nHolly Rubek Joan Sarratt  Jeff Belcher  Barb Murray  Andrew West  Malek Moazzam-Doulat   Kristi Upson-Saia  Dale Wright  Janet Scheel  Alec Schramm  Daniel Snowden-Ifft  Dennis Eggleston  Broderick Fox  George Schmiedeschoff  Mei Ann Chen  Barb Fontana\n\nAnd every other amazing teacher whose first name I couldn\u2019t find!\n", "Songs Sampled:\nSusanna And The Magical Orchestra - Hallelujah\nHoly Other - We Over\nTielsie - Hueboy \nSusanna And The Magical Orchestra - These Days\nLuke Abbott - Modern Driveway\nThe Rice Twins - For Penny and Alexis\nTyphoon - Starting Over\nBurial - Come Down to Us\n", "A special thanks goes out to anyone who has participated in an Open Source project. \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing my teachers taught me it\u2019s that sharing is caring.\n", "Thank You.\n"]}
